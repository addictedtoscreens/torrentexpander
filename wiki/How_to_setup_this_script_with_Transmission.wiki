=Through Transmission interface=

In the transmission GUI, enable the "_call script when torrent is completed_" option and select the path to the _torrentexpander.sh_ script.<p>
You're done !

=Through text editor=

You can also do it the command line way by editing Transmission's settings file, you will find it in:
 * _/$HOME/.config/Transmission/settings.json_
 * _/share/.transmission/settings.json_
and editing those two lines :

{{{
"script-torrent-done-enabled": true,
"script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/torrentexpander.sh $TR_TORRENT_DIR/$TR_TORRENT_NAME"
}}}

With some old versions of Transmission, you may need to use this line instead in Transmission's settings file :

{{{
"script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/torrentexpander.sh"
}}} 


=Troubleshooting=

Transmission is sometimes run by a custom user, leading with some issues when transmission is used to trigger torrentexpander.
There are two ways to solve that

==Quick and dirty way==

By default the transmission daemon runs as debian-transmission on debian or Ubuntu

For reference, this is changed in the following location.
sudo nano /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon

USER=your_login_here

or sometimes

USERNAME=your_login_here


==Recommended way==

First, cd to the desired folder and create a folder for Transmission to use:
cd /home/user/Downloads
mkdir transmission
cd transmission
mkdir completed incomplete torrents

Then, add the username to the group debian-transmission:

sudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission user

This will add debian-transmission as a secondary group to the account user, resulting in access to both Transmission and user. Then, change the ownership of the Transmission download folders to the group debian-transmission:

sudo chgrp -R debian-transmission /home/user/Downloads/transmission

Next, change the permissions for the transmission download folders to allow read, write, and execute for Transmission and your_login

sudo chmod -R 775 /home/user/Downloads/transmission
